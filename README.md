* Configured AWS environment with IAM policies to ensure security and compliance.
* Utilized AWS SageMaker Studio Notebooks for seamless dataset handling and model development.
# Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
* Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Numpy.
* Gleaned actionable insights from the dataset to guide model training and optimization.
# Model Training & Optimization:
* Set up Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs in AWS SageMaker to fine-tune model performance.
* Leveraged GPU instances, including multi-GPU setups, to accelerate model training.
# Model Evaluation:
* Assessed model performance using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score metrics.
* Performed thorough evaluation to ensure high accuracy and reliability of the pneumonia detection classifier.
# Deployment & Integration:

* Deployed the deep learning model using AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions.
* Tested API endpoints with Postman to verify the accuracy of inference results.
